			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<img src="assets/images/kenny_mk.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Kenny Victoria">

			<p>My name is Kenneth Victoria but I go by Kenny! I am 26 years-old and I have been living in the Orlando area for the past 5 years. The same year I moved down here, in 2011, I graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Hospitality and Tourism Management. I am currently a Retail Guest Experience Manager in Walt Disney World and previously was a Front Office Guest Experience Manager also in Walt Disney World. I have always wanted to work in Walt Disney World so I made that dream come true.</p> 

			<p>Now onto my next dream! I want to open my own <em>nerdy</em> or <em>geeky</em> business someday. Becoming a web developer will help me get there because of the people I will meet, the knowledge I will learn, and the flexibilty of the job. I will be able to meet with others developers who I can work together with to create something awesome, I could update the applications or websites myself if need be, and I could literally work anywhere and whenever I wanted.</p>

			<p>Overall, I am a lover of video games, comic books, Saturday morning cartoons, and exercising and eating well because if I didn't write that, I woud have sounded pretty unhealthy. Oh, and I am also into singing and playing some instuments.</p>
